# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.


`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js
